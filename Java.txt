A bit intro of java From - Core Java Volume 1 - elevnt Edition

Java was never just a language.
There are lots of programming languages out there, but few of them make
much of a splash. Java is a whole platform, with a huge library, containing
lots of reusable code, and an execution environment that provides services
such as security, portability across operating systems, and automatic garbage
collection.

The authors of Java wrote an influential white paper that explains their design
goals and accomplishments. They also published a shorter overview that is
organized along the following 11 buzzwords:
1. Simple
2. Object-Oriented
3. Distributed
4. Robust
5. Secure
6. Architecture-Neutral
7. Portable
8. Interpreted
9. High-Performance
10. Multithreaded
11. Dynamic
