A series of exercises that helped me learn the Java programming language better and made me understand the algorithm better

When I first started learning Java, I found myself struggling to understand some of the more complex concepts and algorithms. However, after doing some research and seeking out resources, I discovered a series of exercises that really helped me improve my skills. These exercises allowed me to practice writing code, testing my knowledge, and identifying areas where I needed to improve. One exercise that really helped me was creating a program to find the average of a list of numbers. This exercise forced me to think about how to read in input from the user, store the values in an array, and then calculate the average. It was challenging at first, but after completing the exercise a few times, I felt much more confident in my abilities.Another exercise that helped me was creating a program to sort an array of strings in alphabetical order. This exercise taught me how to use loops and conditional statements to compare and sort values, which was a valuable skill to have when working on more complex algorithms. Overall, these exercises were instrumental in helping me improve my Java programming skills and gain a better understanding of algorithms. They allowed me to practice and refine my skills in a fun and engaging way, and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to improve their programming abilities.
